# Lab 5a - PHP and Web Development 🌐

This repository contains solutions for **Lab 5a**, focusing on using PHP to dynamically generate HTML content. Each question demonstrates essential web development techniques, including working with PHP variables, arrays, loops, and functions.

---

## 🌟 Features

- **Dynamic Content Generation**: PHP scripts generate HTML tables dynamically based on input data or calculations.
- **Reusability**: Implements a PHP function for multiplication, promoting reusable and modular code.
- **Array Manipulation**: Demonstrates the use of associative arrays and loops to render data.
- **HTML Integration**: Combines PHP with HTML to create structured, user-friendly tables.

## 📚 Introduction

This lab exercise showcases PHP's ability to handle and display dynamic data in HTML. It consists of three key tasks:
1. **Display user details in a table** using PHP variables.
2. **Generate and display a student list** using PHP arrays and loops.
3. **Create a multiplication table generator function** that outputs a table for a given multiplier.

## 📖 Questions and Solutions

### 💡 Question 1 - Display User Details

**Description**: In this task, we created a PHP script to display personal user details (such as Name, Matric Number, Course, Year of Study, and Address) in an HTML table format. The PHP variables hold the user’s information, and the table is dynamically generated using PHP `echo` statements.

### 💡 Question 2 - Display Students Table

**Description**: This task involved using a PHP array to store a list of students' details, including their name, matric number, and course. The array is iterated using a `foreach` loop, and the data is displayed in a table format.

### 💡 Question 3 - Multiplication Table Generator

**Description**: In this task, we wrote a PHP function called `multiplication` that takes a multiplier as input and generates a multiplication table for that number (from 1 to 12). The results are stored in an array and displayed in an HTML table. This demonstrates the use of PHP functions and loops to generate dynamic content.
